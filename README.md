### The Insurance Management project is a C# ASP.NET web application that incorporates a many-to-many relationship

The project handles three SQL tables using Entity Framework: authentication, insured persons, and insurance types. It involves managing a database of insured persons.

This is my modified and more complex version of the final exam project (plus with insurance types entity model, some CSS) for the C# exam and obtaining the C# certificate in the czech ITnetwork education portal.
